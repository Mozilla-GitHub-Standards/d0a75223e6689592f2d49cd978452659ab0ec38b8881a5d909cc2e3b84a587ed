      <p>Patents are <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2015/04/15/open-source-software-and-the-patent-system/">challenging for open-source software</a>. But that doesn't mean they aren't challenging for others, too! Thankfully, the heroes from our most beloved RPGs and stories never had to deal with patents. But what if they did?</p>

          <h3>Stranger in the Town Square <button class="walkthrough--toggle">(show)</button></h3>
          <div class="walkthrough--details">
            <p>This stranger is welcoming you to town. If you talk to him he will point you on the right path - joining the Rebellion means venturing out of town, and that means readying yourself for the battle ahead. At the very least, you need to arm yourself, and recruit companions to your cause.</p>

        <div class="walkthrough" id="ring">
          <h3>Common Interest of the RING <button class="walkthrough--toggle">(show)</button></h3>
          <div class="walkthrough--details">
            <p>Word is that a group of individuals are at the Tavern to the South of the Town Square. If you listen to their tale, you will discover that you all share a common goal -- weakening the Evil Empire's grip over the land. You can try to join them, but unfortunately once they discover you don't have any weapons of your own, they will change their mind about teaming up.</p>
            <p><i>Unfortunately, players in many industries treat their patents only as weapons, and refuse to share them with others. The task of saving the world (or changing it) needs people to work together. That's why <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Standards">Mozilla spends a tremendous amount of effort working with others to create open technology standards</a>, which is essential to the interoperability behind the Open Web. After all, what's a Knight without his or her Round Table?</i></p>

          <h3>The Equipment Shop <button class="walkthrough--toggle">(show)</button></h3>
          <div class="walkthrough--details">
              <p>If you ask around, you may hear about the Equipment Shop located along the road leading out of town, to the North. Inside you may find some equipment for sale, but unfortunately using them is not as straightforward as one might hope. Due to licensing and patent restrictions, your money doesn't go as far as you need it to.</p>
            <p><i>Some patent owners have tried to use their patents to restrict or control the use of their products, or even entire markets, way beyond what they could have achieved with other intellectual property laws alone. This can create some very bizarre results for consumers and markets alike -- such as being able to legally obtain a product but not legally being permitted to use it without infringing a patent!</i></p>

        <div class="walkthrough" id="library">
          <h3>The Cursed Library <button class="walkthrough--toggle">(show)</button></h3>
          <div class="walkthrough--details">
            <p>The town's library is Southwest of the Town Square, and it contains ancient knowledge that may aid you. Sadly, that knowledge also carries a terrible curse. The WILLFULNESS Curse causes its victims to take 300% of normal damage in combat. Whether the knowledge is worth the price is anyone's guess.</p>
            <p><i>The patent system is intended to "promote the progress of science and the useful arts" by granting a limited monopoly in exchange for disclosing one's inventions to the public. However, if someone willfully infringes a patent (which requires knowledge of the patent), they may be face treble damages. Add to that the fact that many patents are not particularly helpful for software development, and you end up with a huge body of patent literature that <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2016/01/22/addressing-the-chilling-effect-of-patent-damages/">software companies actively try to avoid.</a></i></p>

          <h3>The Imprisoned Wizard <button class="walkthrough--toggle">(show)</button></h3>
          <div class="walkthrough--details">
            <p>If you venture into the tunnels running underneath the town, you will encounter a Wizard being held prisoner. As he explains, he has been jailed because he cast a CURE 5 spell, and Big Co claims it has the patent to all CURE spells. He will ask for your assistance, and swears he will never try to cast a CURE spell again, but it is up to you whether you want to ally with someone who is facing these types of allegations.</p>
            <p><i>Patents are especially challenging for open source software because, unlike copyright, patents can cover broad concepts -- not just a specific set of implementing code. This creates a great deal of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt over whether a developer can safely ship code for certain "inventions", but also over what the boundaries of those inventions actually are. In turn, this FUD causes many to steer clear entirely from certain areas of innovation because the risk can be too costly.</i></p>
