## Leaving the Town
- The hero finds someone bragging about how he was the chosen hero years ago and constructed a pentagon of power way before BigCorp ever did.
- Hero decides to go on a quest to the Eastern District to show prior art.
- A troll kills the hero when they leave. Hooray!

## Patent Poison (or Curse?)
- See a book sparkling on a shelf or desk somewhere.
- Interact with book. It's a patent!
- Now you're patent poisoned. There's no cure. It shows up in your menu status.
- Status called "Willfully Infringing"?

## One Click
- Enter a shop to buy a weapon.
- Talk to the shopkeeper. Attempt to buy an item. 
- Shopkeeper puts it in your "cart" and offers the ability to check out.
- You can't just buy the item, you have to check out. Someone has a patent on instant buying.

## Patent Hoarding
- Something about local guilds stockpiling their patents as defense against other guilds?

## API Patents
- Wizard in a jail cell for casting a healing spell owned by BigCo, despite using different magic words or ingredients.
- OR
- Find a group of people assembled for an epic quest, LOTR style
- They are talking about forging or searching for the legendary triangle of power that is needed for some reason or another (it should line up directly with your goal)
- You say you are on that quest too
- They say they want to help - you have their sword, their bow, and their axe. :)
- You accept and want to start. They stop and say, "what about you, aren't you contributing anything?" They realize you don't have any patents and the fellowship disbands

## Patented articles
- Enter a shop and buy a weapon
- Try to equip the weapon via inventory
- Either when equipping or when trying to use it, receive an error message [see below under abilities/spells]
- Fine print for weapon: NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED LICENSES TO ANY PATENT CLAIMS, including without limitation the patents of BigCo,
ARE GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ARTICLE. You may use this article only as authorized by appropriate patent licenses.
- Back at the shop, a new item is added: Patent License, which is prohibitively expensive (99999 gold?)

## Patented articles redux
- Shop sells a bow
- Bow is advertised as including a license to use the bow
- Player buys bow and arrows, but gets an error when trying to use
- License for the bow doesn't cover the arrows. Even though arrows are essential for the bow to be useful.
- License for arrows is still prohibitively expensive....

## Spells, Abilities, Status Effects
- Cease and Desist (lose a turn?)
- Settle (escapes combat, but causes you to drop gold)
- File a Motion (just do some damage? maybe a 'confusion' type effect)
- Enjoin (prevents you from using that ability/item for the rest of the fight)

## Other party members
- Find someone who fits party member stereotype (sponny bard!)
- Talk to him/her and discover he has one of the quest items you are looking for
- You both get really excited
- He just ends up leaving you hanging ("well... good luck!")
